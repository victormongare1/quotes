#### By Victor Mongare
## Description
This is a web application created in order to see and post inspirational quotes.It is aplatform for viewing , deleting and adding quotes.There is also an option of upvoting and downvoting quotes.
## BDD
* The app  needed custom components for various parts
* It needed a custom directive to highlight quote with highest upvote
* It needed a custom pipe to manage time
* It needed a form to add new quotes
* It needed an option to delete quotes
* It needed an option to upvote and downvote quotes

## Setup/Installation Requirements
You can gain access to the code for the web landing page by forking from my github repository named quote .You can then make an offline copy by:
    *copying the url from my github repository.
    *typing git clone in the terminal followed by pasting the url
You can also gain access of the web application online at https://victormongare1.github.io/quote 
## Known Bugs
.There are minimal bugs in the webpage.The media queries are not very effective when resizing .The images in the portfolio are also not sized effectively to fit into the webpage.The what we do icons are also not aligned.Report if there are other unknown bugs. The upvote and down vote may also not function effectively.The first quote can also not be deleted
## Technologies Used
I used html in writing the content of the landing page, resizing the images and making the headings bold.I used css and bootstrap in styling the web application.I used typescript to create the logic for upvoting and downvoting quotes ,making new quotes , deleting quotes, and toggling the quotes info.Angular framework was used to ease the design process of the web application.
